# SFS-Closest-Approach-Line
Brings back the beloved closest approach line from SFS old versions

When you select a target, this mod will display the closest approach line that shows the position on the orbit your ship will be the closest to the target.
You can use this to modify your trajectory so that you get an encounter with the desired object.

The closest approach line is displayed in light blue to be easily distinguished from other informations. When the closest approach is getting close to 0, the line gradually turns red to warn you about a collision risk.

This is a less powerful tool than the embedded navigation system, but when this one fails, the closest approach line will still be there for you.
